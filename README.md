dotemacs
========

This is my Emacs configuration -- mostly used for Go, Python, and Clojure software development,
and general text file editing. Bits and pieces are of course cribbed from various other
places. An incomplete list of sources include:

* https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package
* https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d
* http://tuhdo.github.io/
* https://github.com/bradleywright/emacs.d
* https://github.com/martintrojer/dotfiles
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12492/pretty-printing-xml-files-on-emacs
* http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/04/05/recently-visited-files/

This configuration depends on a few other tools:

* [Ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)
* [flake8](http://flake8.readthedocs.org/) (and therefore
  [pyflakes](https://github.com/pyflakes/pyflakes/) and [pep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8))
* [w3m](http://w3m.sourceforge.net/)
* [gocode](https://github.com/nsf/gocode)
